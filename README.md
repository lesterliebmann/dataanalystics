dbt enables data analysts and engineers to transform their data using the same practices that software engineers use to build applications.

Understanding dbt
Analysts using dbt can transform their data by simply writing select statements, while dbt handles turning these statements into tables and views in a data warehouse.

These select statements, or "models", form a dbt project. Models frequently build on top of one another â€“ dbt makes it easy to manage relationships between models, and visualize these relationships, as well as assure the quality of your transformations through testing.
